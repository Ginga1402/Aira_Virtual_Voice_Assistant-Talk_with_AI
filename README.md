## Overview


This project introduces a cutting-edge voice assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, designed to revolutionize user interaction. The application allows seamless conversation with the assistant, which not only answers a wide range of queries but also remembers the context of previous interactions. This memory feature enables the assistant to provide more accurate and context-aware responses over time. By leveraging advanced query handling and the generative capabilities of AI, this voice assistant is ideal for use cases such as customer support, personal assistance, and interactive education, offering a sophisticated, intelligent, and user-friendly experience.


## Tech Stack Used

The following technologies and libraries were used in the development of this chatbot:

[Python](https://www.python.org/): Programming language used for the implementation.

[Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/): LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models.

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/): It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a
variety of applications.

Model Used: [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF) is a family of pre-trained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) released by Meta AI in 2023.
